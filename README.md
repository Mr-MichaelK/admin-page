# admin-page

The aim of this project is to practice my CSS Grid skills by creating an Admin Dashboard where I compile my projects and showcase them.

The design of this dashboard will be based on the design provided by The Odin Project in the Admin Dashboard project. This project's design may slightly differ in terms of looks and functionality, but it remains true to it's purpose, which is providing a coherent representation of strong CSS Grid skills.
