        <h2>I Am a Spirited Web Developer with a Thirst for Learning</h2>
        <div class="main-text">
            <p>Greetings! My name is Michael Kolanjian, and I am a self learning full-stack web developer. I am 19 years of age, pursuing a degree in Computer Science
            at the Lebanese American University of Beirut and a career in web development. I have an eager hunger to improve on my technical and communication skills 
            to outgrow my past self and create a significant impact in the world.</p>
           
            <p>As a second year Computer Science student, I am seeking to build strong technical skills that permit me to work in the tech field. Due to my creative and 
            innovative nature, I found captivating interest in the world of web development which permits me to create webpages however I desire through whatever means
            available. During development, the immediate feedback a webpage shows me and the ease of breaking down development to smaller chunks of work motivate and inspire 
            me to stay curious and master my craft.</p>
            
            <p>After completing my first year at univeristy and developing a strong programming foundation, which involves firm Object Oriented Programming principles, I 
            was eager to find a skill and make a career out of it. Initially, the image before me was very vague, and I was unsure which career path I should follow. 
            Upon further research, I stumbled upon The Odin Project, an open source community funded web development curriculum which seeks to empower learners with all 
            the real life skills a developer needs in their job. I spent my entire summer reading through their lessons and completing their assigned projects, until I 
            found myself capable and willing to develop responsive and adaptive webpages with interactive UI and soothing UX.</p>

            <p>So far, my experience and capabilities extend from designing and building a webpage from scratch through HTML and CSS, to providing additional functionality
                and interaction through JavaScript. Additionally, I am proficient in using Unix based operating systems, specifically Ubuntu Linux. For code maintainability
                I depend heavily on Git and GitHub which permit me to share, discuss, and preserve my code.
            </p>

            <p>My HTML knowledge involves the utilization of various elements including forms, inputs, and SVGs. For styling purposes, I use diverse CSS style rules and modules
                including CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox to improve the overall layout and responsiveness of my websites. As testament to my fluency in both HTML and CSS, I have built 
                several projects as part of The Odin Project curriculum. 
            </p>

            <p>Moreover, I seek to capitalize on my communication skills to become a better teammate and colleague. I expressed proficiency in a public speaking course I took during 
                my second semester at LAU and assumed numerous leadership positions in various projects during both my highschool and university years.
            </p>

            <p>Lastly, I would like to express genuine gratitude towards you for taking the time to learn about me. If you have any further questions in regards to my capabilities, 
                feel free to contact me through whichever means you find convenient. Farewell!
            </p>
